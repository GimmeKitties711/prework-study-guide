        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is the code behind the functionality and formatting of a website.</li>
          <li>The goal is to have the website be laid out in a pleasant way that is beneficial to the user.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>This information is mostly invisible to the user, but it still gives important directions to the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body can include special content like pictures and links to other websites.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS allows us to decide how we want to style our website; we can decide on colors, font sizes, and page layouts.</li>
          <li>Attributes that have the same settings can be decided by the same set of brackets.</li>
          <li>This efficient way of coding is called Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) programming.</li>
          <li>The most efficient method is external CSS, where the CSS file is separate from the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The CSS file needs to be linked to the HTML file for the visual changes to take effect.</li>
          <li>A class can be created in the CSS file, and all elements of that class in the HTML file will be affected by the class's properties.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The purpose of Git is to establish a connection between the local repository on your computer and the remote repository on GitHub.</li>
          <li>To transfer local changes to the server, a pull request is made, and then it is reviewed and approved by colleagues before the changes are merged with the main branch.</li>
          <li>cd: change directory</li>
          <li>pwd: print working directory (to make sure you are in the right place in your files)</li>
          <li>ls: lists all of the files and folders in a directory</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Similarly, git checkout branch-name switches to an existing branch without creating a new one.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the part of web development that allows a user to interact with a website.</li>
          <li>The console can be used to display important messages about the website.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A for loop can be used as an efficient way to iterate through a repetitive action without having to type a unique line for each instance.</li>
          <li>A function can be used to perform a certain set of actions whenever we call its name.</li>
          <li>Simply defining a function is not enough to make it run; it has to be called.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, so you have to define variables before writing out actions pertaining to them.</li>
