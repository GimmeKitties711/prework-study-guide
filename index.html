          <li>To transfer local changes to the server, a pull request is made, and then it is reviewed and approved by colleagues before the changes are merged with the main branch.</li>
          <li>cd: change directory</li>
          <li>pwd: print working directory (to make sure you are in the right place in your files)</li>
