# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help boot camp students get through the Prework. It contains detailed notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

No installations are required.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. The suggestion is randomized every time you refresh the page.
